# **Build Process**
  - [x] Install PSU in case
    - Mount on top of case with fan pointing up & out _UPDATE: ONLY FIT W/ FAN POINTING DOWN, WHICH WAS BETTER (NO VENT ON THE TOP)_
  - [x] INSTALL BACK PLATE! _UPDATE: THE METAL GROUNDING TABS WERE SUCH A PAIN THAT THEY GOT IN THE WAY DURING THE MOBO INSTALL. I BENT MOST OF THEM_
  - [x] Plug PSU into power strip, then ground self to PSU with anti-static band
    - Keep power strip off
  - [x] Install CPU
    - Pay attention to arrows on CPU and MOBO
  - [x] Install CPU cooler
    - Line up pins, then press in with cross-pattern
  - [x] Plug CPU cooler into MOBO
  - [x] Insert RAM
    - First or last two slots
  - [x] Install MOBO standoff screws
    - Might come pre-installed _UPDATE: THEY WERE PRE-INSTALLED_
  - [x] Install MOBO _UPDATE: MOBO ENDED UP SITTING ON CASE FOR A WHILE WHILE I BENT IO SHIELD PINS. ALSO, THE CASE W/ THE PSU WAS SUCH THAT I COULDN'T DIRECTLY DROP THE MOBO INTO THE CASE. I HAD TO TIP IT AND ANGLE IT UNTIL IT FINALLY SAT. IT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE NICKED THE CASE AS IT WENT IN. NOT FUN_
    - Screw with cross pattern
  - [x] Install SSD into case
    - Turn plugs away from PSU _UPDATE: SSD ONLY FIT ONE WAY- WITH PLUGS FACING BACK OF CASE. IT WORKED OUT FINE._
  - [x] Plug PSU into CPU
    - 4-pin _UPDATE: USED ONLY 4 OF 4+4-PIN FROM PSU_
  - [x] Plug SSD SATA data into MOBO
  - [x] Plug SSD power into MOBO
  - [x] Plug in front panel connectors
    - See F_PANEL on Parts Breakdown _UPDATE: NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE_
  - [x] Plug in main power from PSU to MOBO _UPDATE: SMALL CASE WAS A PAIN- HAD TO DISCONNECT 4-PIN FROM 20+4-PIN TO FIT THROUGH HOLES IN CASE_
    - 24-pin
  - [x] Plug chassis fans into MOBO

## **Final Notes:**

  On the first boot, the CPU fan started then stopped. I was just about to accept the inevitable when it picked up again and the BIOS popped up on the monitor. Huzzah!

  I recorded the majority of the build and took a few pictures, but the battery died on the camera. Oh well :)

  All in all it was pretty fun. I was worried that my man-handling of the motherboard might have damaged it, but it works just fine. I had to move the CPU fan wire around because it got in the fan's way, but that worked out fine.

  I've been keeping an eye on CPU temp. During stress tests on all 4 cores, the highest temp was around 62 deg C. That ain't too bad.

  I don't plan on updating this repo after today. QED.
